## R Markdown

In this project, the goal is to predict the manner in which an exercise was done using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website <http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
